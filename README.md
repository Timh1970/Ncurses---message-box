# Ncurses---message-box
This code creates a popup message box with a title and a message.  The box is sized automatically although a width can be specified.  There are 2 versions of the box 1. an info() version where you press any key to exit; and 2. a question version that returns a boolean depending on whether 'y' or 'n' has been pressed
